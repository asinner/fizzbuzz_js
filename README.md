## Approach
Going off of the whiteboard exercise this morning, I started by defining a fizzbuzz function that took two parameters (start, end). Then I creating a mapping of numbers to outputs in an object. Next I used a for loop to start at the start parameter and iterate the number up until it equals the end parameter. Meanwhile, on each iteration of the range that was passed I would loop through the mapping object. I added the mapping output to the string if the current integer in the range was a multiple of the current number in mapping. After the loop of the mapping stopped, I console.log()'d the string if there was anything in it otherwise I console.log()'d the current integer in the range.
